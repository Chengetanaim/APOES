# APOES
Online proctor system
It is a system used to monitor a student during an online examination such that they aren't supposed to have unneccessary movements when writing the exam.
The system also monitors the tabs such that if a student switches a tab, the system will record that in the database.

## What I learnt:

- working with the OpenCV library in Python to monitor a student's movement
- using Javascript's event listener to monitor the switching of tabs
- using the countdown timer in Javascript such that when the time is up for an exam, a student can no longer submit the answers
- integrate the above functionalities into a web application using Django
